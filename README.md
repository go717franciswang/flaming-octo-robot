      data-sources [{:title "Stock A (last 30 minutes)"
                     :url "get_price.json?stock=A"
                     :columns ["volume" "price"]}
                    {:title "Stock B (last 30 minutes)"
                     :url "get_price.json?stock=B"
                     :columns ["volume" "price"]}
                    {:title "Performance (last 30 days)"
                     :url "get_profit.json"
                     :display 30*24*60*60*1000
                     :columns ["revenue" "cost" "profit"]}
  (realtime-chart.core/build-charts options data-sources))
```
#### or call in js
```js
realtime_chart.core.build_charts_from_js(options, data_sources);
```

## Development
```sh
lein cljsbuild auto # rebuild when source is changed

# brepl will listen for connection on port 9000
rlwrap -r -m -q '\\"' -b "(){}[],^%3@\\\";:'" lein trampoline cljsbuild repl-listen
```
connect to brepl with the following code
```clj
(.setOnLoadCallback js/google (fn [] (repl/connect "http://localhost:9000/repl")))
```

## TODO
- [x] if we were to represent the state of chart data as state of modal in http://rigsomelight.com/2013/07/18/clojurescript-core-async-todos.html, the state can contain data from all sources, and only one source will be visible at a given moment. furthermore, one async channel can trigger the moving visibility from one source to another, and another channel that requests data from server
- [x] working prototype
- [x] reduce the memory usage, it should stabilize instead of constantly rising
- [x] call ```build_charts_from_js``` function in js
- [ ] cljs tests
- [?] make it into a library so other cljs can use it
